# **2. Game Rules**

- **AFK farms are allowed** â€“ however, be aware:
  - You may be kicked while AFKing due to server restarts or if your farm causes excessive lag.

- **Bedrock breaking is allowed.**
- **Vanilla duping is allowed** for the following items: **rails, carpet, string, TNT, and all falling blocks (except the Dragon Egg).** *(Note: Not all duplication methods will work due to game version or server software.)*
- **Allowed client modifications** â€“ you may use clients and client-side mods that do not provide an unfair advantage. Approved clients include **Lunar, Badlion, Feather**, and similar tools. Approved mod categories include:
  - **Tooltip mods**
  - **Visual mods**
  - **Utility mods**
  - **Map mods**
