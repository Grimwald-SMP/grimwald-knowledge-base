# ðŸ“š **Donations**

- **Donations are completely optional**â€”no player is required to contribute financially.
- All donations go **directly toward covering the serverâ€™s monthly operating costs**.
- If donations exceed the standard monthly price, **extra funds may be used for necessary performance upgrades** to improve the server experience. If this is not required, donations will be saved to spend on future standard billing cycles.
- **There is no pay-to-win** while we do greatly apreciate all donations, no matter how small-we do not want to provide unfair in-game advantages to donators as we feel this is unfair to the average player who may not be financially able to donate. The only reward is a **special Discord role** as a token of appreciation.
