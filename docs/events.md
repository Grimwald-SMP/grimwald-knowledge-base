# ðŸ“š **Events**

We try to regularly host **community events** to bring players together, encourage friendly competition, and add variety to the gameplay experience. These events are designed to be fun, engaging, and inclusive for all players, regardless of skill level or experience.

# **1. Types of Events**

We run a variety of events throughout each season, including but not limited to:

## **Build Competitions**
- Players compete to create the best builds based on a given theme.
- Themes can range from fantasy castles to futuristic cities.
- Builds are judged based on creativity, detail, and adherence to the theme.
- Prizes may include in-game rewards, bragging rights, or special Discord roles.

## **Minigames**
- Custom-made minigames provide players with a break from regular gameplay.
- Previous Examples include parkour challenges, treasure hunts, or capture the flag.
- Some minigames may be cooperative, while others are competitive.

## **Skin Competitions**
- Players showcase their best Minecraft skins based on a specific theme.
- Themes may include seasonal designs (e.g., Halloween, Christmas) or unique categories (e.g., medieval, sci-fi).
- Judging is typically done by a panel of staff or community voting.

## **PvP Tournaments**
- Players compete in structured PvP battles, either solo or in teams.
- Different formats may include 1v1 duels, battle royales, or structured tournaments.
- Combat mechanics and rules are adjusted based on community feedback to ensure fair play.

# **2. Event Scheduling**

- Events are announced **in advance** on Discord.
- Some events may require player registration, while others are open to all.
- Most events take place **within the current season**, but some special events may occur between seasons. E.g. Hardcore Mini-Seasons.

# **3. Participation & Rules**

- All events are **voluntary**â€”players can join as they wish.
- Events are designed to be **fair and balanced**, ensuring everyone has an equal chance to participate and win.
- Standard server rules still apply during events (e.g., no cheating, griefing, or toxicity). However there may be slight alterations to the rules. E.g. In a PvP game, it doesn't make sense for all players to give permission before each fight.
- The rules of a specific event will be outlined beforehand, Failure to comply with these rules may result in you being banned from participating, breaking server rules during an event will still have the regular consequences.

# **4. Community Involvement**

- Players are encouraged to run their own events. However always run your idea by an Admin who can help you with announcements, player sign-up and ensuring your event will not interfere with players who do not wish to participate.
- Staff may host events too.
- Events do not have to be limited to on the server, You can create events for other games that you and other members of the community share an interest for. However staff will not take any responsibility of these for you other than posting your announcement.
- Feedback is always welcome to improve future events.
