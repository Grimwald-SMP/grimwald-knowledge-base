# ðŸ“š **Seasons**

Seasons in the Grimwald community define different playthroughs of the server. Each season provides a fresh start, allowing players to experience new challenges, worlds, and potential changes to gameplay. Seasons are shaped by the preferences of the community, ensuring an evolving and engaging multiplayer experience.

# **1. How a Season Ends & Begins**

Seasons do not follow a fixed schedule; instead, they continue **as long as the majority of players are still engaged**. When activity starts to decline or players feel ready for a change, a vote is held among the community.

- **Ending a Season**: If the majority votes to conclude the season, the current world is closed, and preparations begin for the next one.
- **Starting a New Season**: Once a season ends, players may discuss and vote on aspects of the upcoming season, such as the world generation settings or any gameplay modifications.

# **2. World Generation & Seeds**

Each new season begins with a new world, but how that world is selected can vary:
- **Random Seed**: Occasionally, the server starts with a completely random seed, offering a fresh and unpredictable experience.
- **Community Voted Seed**: Sometimes, players vote on different potential seeds before deciding on the final one.
- **Curated Selection**: In some cases, admins may select a seed based on specific criteria, such as biome diversity or unique generation features.

Regardless of the method, the goal is always to create a world that feels exciting and encourages exploration and collaboration.

# **3. Season Duration**

Seasons do not have a set duration, but historically, they have varied in length:

- **Early Seasons**: Typically lasted **1-2 months**, often concluding quickly due to player demand for new experiences.
- **Recent Seasons**: Tend to last **3-5 months**, providing a more extended gameplay experience before a reset.
- **Flexible Timing**: Ultimately, a season lasts **as long as the community wants**, ensuring that the server remains enjoyable and active.

# **4. Vanilla & Modded Seasons**

Not every season is the same. The server alternates between different styles of play:

- **Vanilla Seasons**: Feature a pure Minecraft experience, often with only the usual quality-of-life adjustments. 
- **Modded Seasons**: Introduce modifications, ranging from lightweight enhancements to full gameplay overhauls, depending on community preference.

Usually we aim to have every 4th season modded. Modded seasons tend to be shorter however for the following reasons:

- **Costs**: Modded Servers cost a lot more to run than a vanilla season. This means having shorter seasons or less mods.
- **Player Hardware**: Not all players have hardware capable of running the mods. This means they are unable to play during this time.

*Planning a modded season is a balancing act, between minimizing costs and making the server available to as much of our community as possible whilst still adding enough mods that change the game in a way that is enjoyable.*
