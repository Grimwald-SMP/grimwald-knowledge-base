# üìú **Documentation Standards**  

This document outlines the **standards and guidelines** for creating and maintaining content within the **Grimwald Knowledge Base**. By adhering to these standards, we ensure the information remains **consistent, accessible, and clear** for everyone who uses it. Whether you‚Äôre adding new content, updating existing documents, or contributing to the knowledge base in any way, these standards should be followed to maintain quality and usability.  

# **1. Writing Style**  

## **Clarity & Simplicity**  
- Write in **clear, concise language**. Avoid jargon or overly complex sentences.  
- Ensure that each section is easy to **understand** for both new and experienced players.
- Ensure correct punctuation is used.

## **Tone & Voice**  
- Maintain a **neutral** and **professional tone** throughout the documentation.  
- While we encourage an engaging voice, avoid being overly casual. Focus on maintaining an **informative and helpful** tone.  
- **Avoid humor** or informal language unless appropriate for specific contexts.  

## **Consistency**  
- Use **consistent terminology** across all documents. For example, if referring to players with certain roles (e.g., "Admins," "Moderators"), make sure the same terms are used everywhere.  
- For technical terms, provide **definitions or explanations** if they are not common knowledge (e.g., "plugins," "datapacks").  
- **Abbreviations and acronyms** should be spelled out the first time they appear, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses (e.g., "Staff Member (SM)").  
- Use **active voice** whenever possible (e.g., "Players must follow these rules," not "These rules must be followed by players"). 

# **2. Document Structure**  

## **Headings & Subheadings**  
- Use clear, hierarchical **headings** and **subheadings** to break up large blocks of text and improve readability.  
  - Example structure:  
    - **# Main Heading** (for major sections)  
    - **## Subheading** (for secondary sections)  
    - Avoid using other levels of heading.

## **Numbered & Bulleted Lists**  
- Use **bulleted lists** for unordered information and **numbered lists** for step-by-step instructions or when order matters.
- Lists should be simple and to the point, with each bullet or number point containing a single idea.

## **Formatting**
- Use **bold** for important terms, commands, or concepts that need emphasis (e.g., **/ban**).
- Use **italics** for examples or to highlight less important details (e.g., *note*).
- **Code snippets** (commands, config examples) should be wrapped in **backticks** to enclosed them in code blocks.
- Avoid using excessive **caps** or underlining.

## **Links**  
- Use **internal links** for cross-references to other parts of the knowledge base (e.g., [see the Contributing Guidelines](contributing.md)).
- **External links** should open in a new tab and should be relevant to Grimwald, such as linking to resources or tools directly used on the server. 
- Use **clear link text** that describes the destination (e.g., ‚ÄúClick here for the economy setup guide‚Äù instead of ‚Äúclick here‚Äù).

## **3. Content Guidelines**  

## **Accuracy & Up-to-Date Information**
- Only **accurate, verified information** should be included in the knowledge base.  
- Always check that any changes to the server, rules, or guidelines are reflected in the documentation.
- If you're unsure of a specific detail, check with the relevant staff member or consult other sources before publishing or submitting for review. 

## **Completeness**
- Each document should cover the subject **comprehensively**. Ensure that all aspects of the topic are explained, including potential FAQs or common issues.
- If necessary, include **step-by-step instructions**, **examples**, and **troubleshooting tips** for clarity.

## **Objectivity**
- Maintain an **objective** point of view when discussing issues such as player reports, rule enforcement, or conflict resolution.  
- Avoid personal opinions or biased language.
- Avoid sentitive topics, real world drama or anything that could be damaging to the brand. [see the Brand Guidelines](brand-guidelines.md).
- Do not mention players or members of staff by their real or online names anywhere in these documents.

## **Community Input**
- All major changes or new sections should be **reviewed by staff** before being finalized.
- Encourage players to **provide feedback** on documents that are unclear or incomplete.

# **4. Updating the Knowledge Base**

## **Review Process**  
- **Staff members** should periodically review documentation for accuracy and clarity.  
- **Changelog entries** should be included whenever a significant change is made to a document.

## **Version Control**  
- Maintain **version control** for all documents.

# **5. Accessibility** 

## **Language & Localization**  
- Consider the **global nature** of Grimwald and avoid region-specific language or terms.
- All docs should be written in American English (E.g. localization instead of localisation, color instead of colour.)

# **6. AI**

## **Using AI To Adhere To Standards**
- This document can be fed to AI alongside your new or changed document to ensure you are adhering to the standards.
- If you use AI, Please throughly review the AIs suggested changes before deciding if you should implement them.
