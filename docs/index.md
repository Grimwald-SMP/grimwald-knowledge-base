# Grimwald Knowledge Base

Welcome to the Grimwald Knowledge Base, the central hub for all information related to the Grimwald SMP. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for players, staff, and administrators,
covering everything from server rules and moderation policies to technical maintenance, branding guidelines, and community engagement. Our goal is to ensure that anyone involved in Grimwald—whether
a new player, a seasoned veteran, or a staff member—can quickly find the information they need to navigate, enjoy or contribute to the server.

## Purpose of these Docs
The Grimwald Knowledge Base is designed to:

- Provide clear, structured guidance on server rules, community standards, and staff responsibilities.
- Provide information to players about how everything works on the server, from our shops and economy, to seasons and events and the quality of life plugins we run the server with.
- Offer detailed technical documentation for server maintenance, plugin management, website updates, and other administrative tasks.
- Act as a living document, regularly updated by staff and community members to reflect the latest developments in Grimwald SMP.

## Keeping the Docs updated
To keep this knowledge base reliable and useful, we encourage all staff members to:

- Regularly review and update information as the server evolves.
- Ensure that any major changes—whether related to game mechanics, server rules, or community policies—are discussed and agreed upon by staff and (where applicable) players before being applied to the server.
- Clearly document updates in the changelogs, to maintain consistency and clarity.
- Use a standardized format for all entries to keep information easy to navigate and understand.
