This documents provides a guide on managing server payments.

# **1. Server Costs**

- We usually run the server with Pebblehost Budget 10GB Plan for vanilla seasons, which is usually sufficient.
- The server can be upgraded to premium tier which boosts perfomance and gives new features or the amount of RAM can be upgraded.
- Modded seasons in general are a lot shorter because they need a lot better hardware to run, making them costly.

# **2. Making Payments or Upgrading**

- Login to the [Pebblehost Billing Panel](https://billing.pebblehost.com/index.php?rp=/login)
- Here you can view invoices, make payments or upgrade the server.
