# üõ°Ô∏è **Staff Guidelines**

This document outlines the responsibilities, command usage, and expectations for staff members.

---

# **1. Responsibilities**
Staff members play a crucial role in maintaining the server. While this is a volunteer position, when available, staff should:
- Assist players when needed.
- Enforce rules and issue punishments where necessary.
- Participate in admin discussions (voice chat not required).
- Welcome new players, guide them to the rules, and whitelist them.
- Ban bots or hacked accounts in chat.
- Post announcements or polls when required.
- Notify other admins of any extended absences if possible, so new admins can be recruited if necessary.
- Some admins may have specialized roles, such as handling advertising.

---

# **2. Punishments**
- Always ensure a rule has been broken before issuing a punishment.
- Bans should be based on rules, not personal disagreements. Stay unbiased.
- If someone immediately breaks the rules upon joining, they are responsible for not reading them. In most cases, this warrants a permanent ban unless minor.
- If a trusted member breaks the rules, consult with other admins if necessary, but do not let their status exempt them from punishment.
- **Zero tolerance for hate speech, harassment, and bullying**. This includes racism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and similar offenses. **Permanent bans should be issued for these.**

---

# **3. Command Usage**
## **Using Commands for Personal Gain or Assisting Players Unfairly**
- Commands should not be used for personal advantage or cheating.
- Do not teleport yourself or others for non-moderation reasons.
- Do not use `/oi` (open inventory) to transfer items between players, steal, or read personal content like written books.
- Do not exploit your admin status to manipulate players.

## **Exceptions**
- **End Fight or similar events**: Teleporting latecomers to the stronghold is permitted to ensure a timely start.
- **Bug-related losses**: Players may be refunded from creative mode or given XP **only** if they died due to a bug. (If using a grave system, ensure the grave did not spawn first to prevent item duplication.)
- **Returning stolen items**: Items may be transferred via `/oi` only for restoring stolen property.

---

# **4. Specific Command Guidelines**
## **CoreProtect**
- Always screenshot logs before issuing punishments for evidence.
- Players should **never** have access to inspection commands to prevent vigilante actions.
- **Only rollback for griefing**, not accidental explosions (e.g., creepers) unless another player caused damage maliciously.
- Prevent duplication by ensuring that rolling back does not restore removed items **after** they were manually retrieved from chests.

## **OpenInv**
- Do not manipulate players' inventories or remove items without reason.
- Avoid checking shulker boxes unless necessary. If you lack a preview mod, place them **only while the player is offline** and return them as found.
- Screenshot inventories when investigating theft, x-ray usage, or duping.
- Never plant evidence.

## **Vanish**
- Use vanish **only** when investigating potential rule-breaking.
- Do not use it to spy on people or listen in on interactions.
- Do not remain in vanish mode indefinitely to avoid staff responsibilities.

# **5. Logging & Integrity**
All actions are logged and can be reviewed:
- **Abusing admin privileges will result in removal.**
- Staff must follow all standard player rules in addition to these guidelines.
- Rule-breaking as an admin may lead to both removal and standard player punishments (e.g., bans).

By following these guidelines, staff help maintain a fair and enjoyable environment for all players.
