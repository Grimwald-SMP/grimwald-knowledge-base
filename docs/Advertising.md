# ðŸ“¢ **Advertising Guide**

This document provides a **guide for advertising the Grimwald server** to attract new members. Follow these standards to maintain a consistent and effective presence across platforms.

# **1. Posting Ads**

## **Where to Advertise**
- Primary advertising platforms:
  - [r/MinecraftBuddies](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftBuddies/) (**Java-Hosting** flair)
  - [r/mcservers](https://www.reddit.com/r/mcservers/) (**SMP** flair)
  - [r/MinecraftServer](https://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftServer/) (**Advertising** flair)
- You are encouraged to advertise in other relevant communities as well, as long as they permit server advertisements and align with Grimwald's standards.
- You are also free to expand and advertise on other platforms too but we have not done this in the past.

---

# **2. When To Advertise**
- You should post ads when the server activity is low.
- Ads can be posted mid season or in preperation for the beginning of a new season.
- Grimwald is designed to be a small server, adding people is fine when needed but don't post ads for new people excessively.

# **3. Reddit Advertisement Templates**

## **Post Title**
```
Grimwald SMP [SMP]{java}{1.21}{Semi-Vanilla}{16+}{whitelist}{discord}
```
- Replace `1.21` with the **current server version**.
- Replace `Semi-Vanilla` with `Modded` if advertising a modded season.
- Adjust the **age limit** if it changes.
- **Note:** r/mcservers strictly enforces this title format. You can be more creative with titles on other subreddits if permitted.

## **Post Body**
```

# **4. Special Cases When Posting**

- Some subreddits (e.g., **r/MinecraftBuddies**) **do not allow links** in posts.
- In such cases, replace the application link with one of the following alternatives:
  - *"Not allowed to post links here, check my other recent posts for the application link."* (if you have posted elsewhere recently)
  - *"Not allowed to post links here, check my bio for the application link."* (if you have the link in your Reddit profile bio)
