# Advertising Guide
- This document aims to provide a guide for advertising the server in order to get new members.

# Posting Ads
## Where to advertise
- We usually advertise to reddit in the following communities:
    - r/MinecraftBuddies (Java-Hosting Flair)
    - r/mcservers (SMP Flair)
    - r/MinecraftServer (Advertising Flair)
- However you can advertise wherever you want.

## Reddit advertisement templates
- For the title
```
Grimwald SMP [SMP]{java}{1.21}{Semi-Vanilla}{16+}{whitelist}{discord}
```

- Replace 1.21 with the current version the server is running
- Semi-Vanilla can be replaced with Modded for modded seasons.
- Age limit can be replaced in the event the age limit changes
- r/mcservers strictly enforces this title naming convention, but feel free to be more creative on other subreddits.

- For the body
```

- Vanilla tweaks datapacks for quality of life

- Coreprotect instead of land claim to protect the server against theft and griefing (This allows us to revert the world to previous states and ban those responsible)

- Vanilla like configs, TNT, rail and carpet duping is allowed, bedrock breaking works etc.

- Feel free to change the description or expand on it.
- Some subreddits (Just r/MinecraftBuddies out of the ones listed above) don't allow links, If this is the case replace the link with one of the following:
    - `Not allowed to post links here, check my other recent posts for the application link' (Assuming you have posted to other subreddits beforehand)
    - 'Not allowed to post links here, check my bio for the application link' (Assuming you have the link in your bio)
