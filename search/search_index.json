Follow these standards to maintain a consistent and effective presence across platforms. 1. Posting Ads Where to Advertise Primary advertising platforms: r/MinecraftBuddies ( Java-Hosting flair) r/mcservers ( SMP flair) r/MinecraftServer ( Advertising flair) You are encouraged to advertise in other relevant communities as well, as long as they permit server advertisements and align with Grimwald's standards. You are also free to expand and advertise on other platforms too but we have not done this in the past. 2. When To Advertise You should post ads when the server activity is low. Ads can be posted mid season or in preperation for the beginning of a new season. Grimwald is designed to be a small server, adding people is fine when needed but don't post ads for new people excessively. 3. Reddit Advertisement Templates Post Title Grimwald SMP [SMP]{java}{1.21}{Semi-Vanilla}{16+}{whitelist}{discord} Replace 1.21 with the current server version . Replace Semi-Vanilla with Modded if advertising a modded season. Adjust the age limit if it changes. Note: r/mcservers strictly enforces this title format. You can be more creative with titles on other subreddits if permitted. Post Body About Us We are a small, mainly vanilla server with quality of life datapacks from Vanilla Tweaks and essential plugins to protect against hackers and griefers. Anyone is welcome as long as they follow the rules. Features - Proximity voice chat (optional) - Vanilla Tweaks datapacks for quality of life improvements - CoreProtect instead of land claims to protect the server (allows world rollbacks and bans for griefers) - Hard difficulty - Democracy \u2014 major server decisions are voted on by the players - Updates to new Minecraft versions soon after release - Vanilla-like configs \u2014 TNT, rail, and carpet duping allowed; bedrock breaking enabled - Friendly and active community - Minigames and events - Group projects - No pay-to-win elements or vote rewards Apply Here: https://forms.gle/uKNZd6JzVjRjQK5H9 Update details as needed depending on the current season. You are encouraged to expand or personalize the description if appropriate while maintaining a professional and inviting tone. 4. Special Cases When Posting Some subreddits (e.g., r/MinecraftBuddies ) do not allow links in posts. In such cases, replace the application link with one of the following alternatives: \"Not allowed to post links here, check my other recent posts for the application link.\" (if you have posted elsewhere recently) \"Not allowed to post links here, check my bio for the application link.\" (if you have the link in your Reddit profile bio)","title":"\ud83e\udec2 Advertising"},{"location":"advertising/#advertising-guide","text":"This document provides a guide for advertising the Grimwald server to attract new members.

Vanilla Commands These are built-in Minecraft commands available to admins: /ban <username> \u2013 Bans a player from the server. /kick <username> \u2013 Kicks a player from the server (they can rejoin immediately). /tp <your username> <destination or username> \u2013 Teleports you to a player or specific location. /restart \u2013 Restarts the server without data loss. Use this if the server is experiencing severe lag. Before restarting, check with other players to confirm the issue isn't client-side. /tps \u2013 Displays the server's ticks per second (TPS) , a key performance metric: 20 TPS = Ideal performance. Below 15 TPS = Consider restarting the server. If frequent low TPS persists = Hardware upgrades may be required. 2. Datapack & Plugin Management Datapack Commands Never use /reload \u2013 This can break plugins and cause server instability. /datapack list \u2013 Lists all installed datapacks, showing which are enabled/disabled. /datapack enable <datapack_name> \u2013 Enables a specific datapack. Installing Plugins: Requires a full server restart ( /restart ) or using the server console . Note that depending on the server setup, /restart may shut down the server without restarting it. 3. Plugin Commands CoreProtect /co i \u2013 Toggles inspector mode: Right-click = Check block interactions. Left-click = Check chest/container transactions. /co l <page_number> \u2013 Select a page to view in logs from inspector mode. /co rollback <radius> <time> \u2013 Rolls back an area to a previous state. Use log timestamps to determine the rollback time. Be aware that some redstone machines (e.g., flying machines) may break when rolled back. Optional rollback filters: - <username> \u2013 Rollback actions from a specific user. - <include items> \u2013 Specify items/blocks to restore. - <exclude items> \u2013 Specify items/blocks to ignore. - <action> \u2013 Rollback only certain actions.

Command Usage Guidelines For specific instructions on command usage and staff protocols, refer to the Staff Guidelines . 5. Permission Groups The server has different permission levels we use these need set up with a permissions manager plugin (We usually use Luckperms ) based on responsibility and trust: Whitelister \u2013 Trusted non-staff members who can add/remove players from the whitelist . (Use caution when assigning this role to prevent abuse.) Inspector \u2013 Entry-level staff who are limited to whitelisting players, inspecting logs, and issuing temporary bans who must consult higher staff before permanent ban. Staff \u2013 Full moderation access, including all commands listed in this document. Op (Operator) \u2013 Highest permission level, typically reserved for the owner(s) .

Making Changes Clone your forked repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/Grimwald-SMP/grimwald-knowledge-base.git Navigate to the project directory: cd grimwald-knowledge-base Create a new branch for your changes: git checkout -b your-feature-branch Make the necessary changes in your local copy. Follow the Documentation Standards for formatting and writing guidelines. Test your changes locally (see section on MkDocs below). Submitting a Pull Request Once your changes are complete: Commit your changes: git add . git commit -m \"Description of changes made\" Push your branch to your forked respository: git push origin your-feature-branch Go to the GitHub Repostory and create a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the main repositories main branch. Ensure your PR: Includes edits to the changelog.md file explaining your changes. Adheres to the standards. Admins will review the PR, and after any necessary revisions, your changes will be merged into the main repository. 3. Working with MkDocs The Grimwald Knowledge Base is built using MkDocs . To view and preview your changes locally, follow these steps: Installing MkDocs If you haven't already you will need to install python on your machine. Download on Python.org If you haven't already installed MkDocs, you can do so by running: pip install mkdocs Running the Development Server To preview your changes locally, you need to run the development server: Navigate to your forked repository's root directory: cd grimwald-knowledge-base Start the MkDocs development server: mkdocs serve Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser to preview the documentation. Building and deploying the Docs If you are an admin you will also need to know how to build and deploy the docs. You should build and deploy after every change to main . If you are an admin and are the one making or the one who reviewed and accepted the changes you are responsible for doing this yourself. After merging the required changes from a PR into the main branch, Run the following command to build the documentation into a static site and deploy it to GitHub Pages : mkdocs gh-deploy . Warning Using this command will deploy the site from your local branch, including changes that have not been commited, delete or stash changes first. You will need to be a collaborator in the repository to perform this command. Dealing with Merge Conflicts If there are merge conflicts: - Make sure you pull the latest changes from the main repostitory: git pull origin main - Resolve the conflicts and push the changes. 4. Additional Notes Please refrain from editing brand-related documents or documents relating to Grimwald's core identity and values unless you have been explicitly told to by an admin, If you are an admin you should make sure the owner(s) are ok with this change. This applies to major changes and not fixes such as correcting typos. Keep your pull requests small and focused on a single task or feature. This makes them easier to review and less prone to errors. Always test your changes locally to ensure everything is working as expected before submitting your PR. Bare in mind if you build the docs locally, they may not behave as expected when opening the html files as some features do not work until they are hosted on a server, Instead you should stick to viewing them on the development server. By following these guidelines, you ensure that Grimwald\u2019s Knowledge Base remains organized, up-to-date, and helpful to all users.","title":"\ud83d\udcdc Contributing"},{"location":"contributing/#contributing-guidelines","text":"We welcome contributions from everyone in the Grimwald SMP community!

Bare in mind if you build the docs locally, they may not behave as expected when opening the html files as some features do not work until they are hosted on a server, Instead you should stick to viewing them on the development server. By following these guidelines, you ensure that Grimwald\u2019s Knowledge Base remains organized, up-to-date, and helpful to all users.","title":"4.

No restrictions on competition \u2014multiple players can sell the same item, and there are no limitations on how many shops a player can own. 2. The Shopping District To create a central hub for commerce, each season has a dedicated Shopping District , which is chosen near the start of the season by community consensus. The Shopping District is the recommended location for shops, as it ensures accessibility and visibility for all players. Players can build shops elsewhere, but those locations may receive less traffic . The district is usually located in an open, large, accessible area , ensuring easy navigation for players.

These events are designed to be fun, engaging, and inclusive for all players, regardless of skill level or experience. 1. Types of Events We run a variety of events throughout each season, including but not limited to: Build Competitions Players compete to create the best builds based on a given theme. Themes can range from fantasy castles to futuristic cities. Builds are judged based on creativity, detail, and adherence to the theme. Prizes may include in-game rewards, bragging rights, or special Discord roles. Minigames Custom-made minigames provide players with a break from regular gameplay. Previous Examples include parkour challenges, treasure hunts, or capture the flag. Some minigames may be cooperative, while others are competitive. Skin Competitions Players showcase their best Minecraft skins based on a specific theme. Themes may include seasonal designs (e.g., Halloween, Christmas) or unique categories (e.g., medieval, sci-fi). Judging is typically done by a panel of staff or community voting. PvP Tournaments Players compete in structured PvP battles, either solo or in teams. Different formats may include 1v1 duels, battle royales, or structured tournaments. Combat mechanics and rules are adjusted based on community feedback to ensure fair play. 2. Event Scheduling Events are announced in advance on Discord. Some events may require player registration, while others are open to all. Most events take place within the current season , but some special events may occur between seasons. E.g. Hardcore Mini-Seasons. 3. Participation & Rules All events are voluntary \u2014players can join as they wish. Events are designed to be fair and balanced , ensuring everyone has an equal chance to participate and win. Standard server rules still apply during events (e.g., no cheating, griefing, or toxicity). However there may be slight alterations to the rules. E.g. In a PvP game, it doesn't make sense for all players to give permission before each fight. The rules of a specific event will be outlined beforehand, Failure to comply with these rules may result in you being banned from participating, breaking server rules during an event will still have the regular consequences. 4. Community Involvement Players are encouraged to run their own events. However always run your idea by an Admin who can help you with announcements, player sign-up and ensuring your event will not interfere with players who do not wish to participate. Staff may host events too. Events do not have to be limited to on the server, You can create events for other games that you and other members of the community share an interest for. However staff will not take any responsibility of these for you other than posting your announcement. Feedback is always welcome to improve future events.

Admin: Luckperms - Allows admins to set up permissions groups to allow or deny certain people access to certain commands. Coreprotect - Logging and rollbacks. SuperVanish - Allows admins to become invisble. ProtocolLib - Required for SuperVanish to work correctly . OpenInv - Allows admins to check inventories or enderchests. Plan - Gathers loads of stats about the server, which can be helpful for admins. 2. Installation Download all of the plugins above. Navigate to PebbleHost File Manager/plugins Place all of the downloaded plugin jars in this folder. Restart the server. Once the server restarts the plugins will be installed, but some will need configured. If the server does not start, check console to see if there any any errors, Plugins usually work across versions but for some plugins you may need a specific version. After each edit, press the green \"Save Content\" button. 3. Configuration Some plugins have no configuration so will not be listed here. Only the config options we use will be documented, any other options you will have to look into yourself. Welcome Message Open plugins/welcomeMessage/config.yml. Replace whatever is inside the quotations with &6Welcome to Grimwald SMP Season 21 %player% changing the season number to the correct one. Better Multiplayer Sleep Open plugins/BetterMultiplayerSleep/config.yml. You can change the default sleep percentage to match whatever you want it to be in game. Usually we stay with 0 though so only one person needs to sleep to skip to day. SuperVanish Open plugins/SuperVanish/config.yml. Find the \"Fly\" section. In this section make sure \"Enable\" is set to false and \"DisableOnReappear\" is set to true . DiscordSRV Open plugins/DiscordSRV/config.yml. Add the Discord Bot Token in the \"BotToken\" field. Go onto discord and enable developer mode you do not have it enabled already. This allows you to copy channel IDs. In the \"Channels: {\"global\" : \"\"}\" insert the ID of channel you want to use in the quotations. Usually 849310724844027941 . In the \"DiscordInviteLink\" insert the permanent link in the quotations. You can find this on discord. Dynmap Open plugins/dynmap/configuration.txt. Change the \"deftemplatesuffix\" to vlowres . Change \"allowwebchat\" and \"allowchat\" to false . Go into the \"Additional Ports\" tab on Pebblehost, Click add port. Leave a note stating what this port is for. Then note down the port number. Back in the config, change \"webserver-port\" to the value of the port you just created, usually a four digit number. The link can be found at http://ip:port where ip is the servers IP and port is the new port you just created and set in the webserver-port option. SimpleVoiceChat Go into the \"Additional Ports\" tab on Pebblehost, Click add port. Leave a note stating what this port is for. Then note down the port number. Open plugins/voicechat/voicechat-server.properties. Change \"port\" to the value of the port you just created, usually a four digit number. Plan Go into the \"Additional Ports\" tab on Pebblehost, Click add port. Leave a note stating what this port is for. Then note down the port number. Open plugins/Plan/config.yml. Find the \"Webserver\" section. In this section change \"Port\" to the value of the port you just created, usually a four digit number. Go into the server.properties and ensure the \"server-ip\" is set to the servers-ip (Without the port). Optionally you can enable location tracking which tells you which countries your players are from, To do this: Read the Geolite2 Eula In the conig, find the \"Data_gathering\" section. Change \"Geolocations\" to true Change \"Accept_Geolite2_EULA\" to true, if you have read and agreed to the terms. At the moment anyone with the link can access this site, you could secure it if you wanted to but this is more technical. Find out more Now that all the plugins are configured restart the server again and the configuration should be applied. 3. Luckperms Although the server is set up luckperms permission groups will need to be added. By default luckperms will block most plugin permissions from everyone, You should add some default permissions to the everyone group and create new groups for admin permissions. The easiest way to do this is with the editor, run `/lp-editor' from in game, which will open a web editor view. Make sure you give everyone permissions to speak and listen with voicechat. There are a lot of things you can do with luckperms so rather than describe all of them here you can read the Wiki . 4. Pre-Generating The World Chunky can be used to pre-generate chunks. (Quickly load and unload each chunk within a certain area). This is useful for dynmap, which cannot render chunks until they have been loaded at least once. Run /chunky radius <radius> or /chunky corners to set the area. Then run /chunky start to start the pre-generation task. Once this is complete start the dynmap render with /dynmap fullrender . Warning, the chunky pre-generation task and the dynmap full render task can take a while and whilst they are running server-performance may be significantly worse. You may wish to run these before opening the world up to players or not run them at all and let dynmap render areas as they are explored.","title":"\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Plugins"},{"location":"plugins/#plugins","text":"This document provides a clear and concise guide for setting up the plugins we use on the server.","title":"\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Plugins"},{"location":"plugins/#1-plugins-list","text":"General: DiscordSRV - Minecraft <-> Discord chat.

Downloading the World & Fixing Paper Format Download the world folder from the server. Tip: Also download the whitelist.json file, this can be uploaded for the new season to prevent manually whitelisting everyone again. If using Paper If the server runs Paper, you must also download world_nether and world_the_end . Extract the compressed file and create a backup copy before making changes. Open world_nether and copy DIM-1 folder. Paste this into the main world folder. Open world_the_end and copy DIM1 folder. Paste this into the main world folder. Note: Older seasons may lack Nether/End data due to this issue being discovered later. 2. Trimming the World Reducing world size before upload saves space and makes the download more accessible especially if the world has additional loaded chunks for dynmap purposes that have not been explored by players. Requirements Install MCA Selector Steps Make a backup of the world. Open MCA Selector \u2192 File > Open World \u2192 select world folder. When prompted, select the overworld . Once loaded, go to Tools > Filter Chunks and apply this filter: InhabitedTime < 5 minutes Change Action to Delete , and check Overwrite Selection . Click OK to delete unnecessary chunks. Repeat steps 2\u20136 for the Nether and End if required by going to File > Open Dimension . Test there are no issues trimmed world by placing a copy of it in your saves folder.

Game Rules"},{"location":"seasons/","text":"\ud83d\udcda Seasons Seasons in the Grimwald community define different playthroughs of the server. Each season provides a fresh start, allowing players to experience new challenges, worlds, and potential changes to gameplay. Seasons are shaped by the preferences of the community, ensuring an evolving and engaging multiplayer experience. 1. How a Season Ends & Begins Seasons do not follow a fixed schedule; instead, they continue as long as the majority of players are still engaged . When activity starts to decline or players feel ready for a change, a vote is held among the community. Ending a Season : If the majority votes to conclude the season, the current world is closed, and preparations begin for the next one. Starting a New Season : Once a season ends, players may discuss and vote on aspects of the upcoming season, such as the world generation settings or any gameplay modifications. 2. World Generation & Seeds Each new season begins with a new world, but how that world is selected can vary: - Random Seed : Occasionally, the server starts with a completely random seed, offering a fresh and unpredictable experience. - Community Voted Seed : Sometimes, players vote on different potential seeds before deciding on the final one. - Curated Selection : In some cases, admins may select a seed based on specific criteria, such as biome diversity or unique generation features. Regardless of the method, the goal is always to create a world that feels exciting and encourages exploration and collaboration. 3. Season Duration Seasons do not have a set duration, but historically, they have varied in length: Early Seasons : Typically lasted 1-2 months , often concluding quickly due to player demand for new experiences. Recent Seasons : Tend to last 3-5 months , providing a more extended gameplay experience before a reset. Flexible Timing : Ultimately, a season lasts as long as the community wants , ensuring that the server remains enjoyable and active. 4. Vanilla & Modded Seasons Not every season is the same. The server alternates between different styles of play: Vanilla Seasons : Feature a pure Minecraft experience, often with only the usual quality-of-life adjustments. Modded Seasons : Introduce modifications, ranging from lightweight enhancements to full gameplay overhauls, depending on community preference. Usually we aim to have every 4th season modded. Modded seasons tend to be shorter however for the following reasons: Costs : Modded Servers cost a lot more to run than a vanilla season. This means having shorter seasons or less mods. Player Hardware : Not all players have hardware capable of running the mods. This means they are unable to play during this time. Planning a modded season is a balancing act, between minimizing costs and making the server available to as much of our community as possible whilst still adding enough mods that change the game in a way that is enjoyable. 5. Events During a Season Throughout a season, various events take place to keep gameplay fresh and engaging. see Events . Seasons in Grimwald are a collaborative and evolving experience , shaped by the community\u2019s interests and engagement. Whether playing in a random vanilla world or an intricate modded setup, each season is designed to bring new challenges and adventures for everyone involved.","title":"\ud83d\udcda Seasons"},{"location":"seasons/#seasons","text":"Seasons in the Grimwald community define different playthroughs of the server.

Events During a Season"},{"location":"server-setup/","text":"\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Server Setup This document provides a clear and concise guide for setting up a Minecraft server. It is written specifically for Grimwald staff but is applicable to anyone using a Minecraft hosting services. 1. Preparing the Server Environment Hosting Provider We use Pebblehost for hosting the Grimwald server. Login to the Pebblehost Panel Ensure you are managing the correct server instance. Loader Config Navigate to PebbleHost Loader Enable Auto Reboot on Crash Ensure Java Version is set to automatically detect. If you face any issues related to java version later on you may need to set this to the correct type for your server's jar. Selecting the Server Type Turn off the server. Navigate to the \"Jar Manager\" section in the panel. Choose the latest stable version of Paper that matches the desired Minecraft version. If a new version has recently came out, check the PaperMC Website and ensure there is a stable build for the version you want to use. Experimental versions may appear on the server hosting site, but it is up to you if you want to use those or wait for a full release version. Experimental Builds may have bugs! Click Install Jar to apply the changes. Restart the server to install the server software setup. Custom Jar If you want a different jar other than paper you may be able to follow a similar process to above, just selecting the jar you want. If the jar you want is not listed you will have to do it yourself. Download the Jar you want from the official website of that server software, E.g. Fabric, Forge. You made or may not need to download the official vanilla server minecraft jar for the same game version. Zip the jar file(s) up and upload them to the server. Right click the zipped folder and choose unarchive. You can now delete the zipped folder. Navigate to settings, and in the section that says jarfile, change the jarfile name to the name of the custom jar you uploaded. Restart the server to install the server software setup. 2. Configuring Server Properties Open the **\"File Manager\" and then \"server.properties\" file. Ensure these values are set: difficulty=hard gamemode=survival motd=Grimwald SMP S<Season Number> online-mode=true //Disabling this is allows anyone to join the server bypassing authentication, never disable it. pvp=true =0 //This makes it so there is no spawn protection, you may want to protect a little area depending on what is at spawn. You can optionally change other values but ensure you know exactly what they are doing and what effect they will have. The only other ones we ever tend to change are spawn protection, and those related to server resource packs. Save and restart the server after making changes. If you want to use a specific seed you can do so in the seed= part of the server.properties. 3. Server Management Worlds If using a random seed or specific seed then the server will generate this for you on restart If starting with a pre-generated world: Ensure your worlds are named as world , world_nether , and world_the_end for paper. If using fabric you will need store the nether and end inside the world folder as DIM-1 and DIM1 respectively. Zip the world folder(s), upload the zip and then right click and unarchive. You can now delete the zipped folder. Ensure the level-name in server.properties matches your main world folder name. Paper Settings Paper will generate the paper.yml , spigot.yml , and bukkit.yml files on first run. Paper patches some things that many players consider features, you can enable some of these again via these config files. Once you have these settings as you want them and the world in place (if using a custom one), restart the server. 4. Whitelist and Operators Ensure white-list=true in server.properties . Add approved players to the whitelist using either the console or by uploading whitelist.json file. Example command: whitelist add PlayerName Adding Operators (Owner) Use the following command in the console: op PlayerName Operators have full command access, so ideally only one owner should be granted this status. 5. Plugins and Datapacks Installation For instructions on installing and configuring plugins, see the Plugins Setup guide . For instructions on installing datapacks, see the Datapacks guide . 6. Scheduled Tasks You may want to set up scheduled tasks for server restarts, This helps with performance. On the PebbleHost Panel, Go to \"Scheduled Tasks\" and press \"Create Schedule\" Call it \"Restart\" and you can just use the AI feature to generate the schedule which will format it correctly. E.g. \"Everyday at 11.30pm\" (Aim for half an hour before you want the reset) Open this schedule and add the following tasks: Send Command, say \"Server restarting in 30 minutes , Continues on failure. Send Command, say \"Server restarting in 15 minutes , Continues on failure, 900s later. Send Command, say \"Server restarting in 5 minutes , Continues on failure, 600s later. Send Command, say \"Server restarting in 1 minutes , Continues on failure, 240s later.

Scheduled Tasks"},{"location":"staff-guidelines/","text":"\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Staff Guidelines This document outlines the responsibilities, command usage, and expectations for staff members. 1. Responsibilities Staff members play a crucial role in maintaining the server. While this is a volunteer position, when available, staff should: - Assist players when needed. - Enforce rules and issue punishments where necessary. - Participate in admin discussions (voice chat not required). - Welcome new players, guide them to the rules, and whitelist them. - Ban bots or hacked accounts in chat. - Post announcements or polls when required. - Notify other admins of any extended absences if possible, so new admins can be recruited if necessary. - Some admins may have specialized roles, such as handling advertising. 2. Punishments Always ensure a rule has been broken before issuing a punishment. Bans should be based on rules, not personal disagreements. Stay unbiased. If someone immediately breaks the rules upon joining, they are responsible for not reading them. In most cases, this warrants a permanent ban unless minor. If a trusted member breaks the rules, consult with other admins if necessary, but do not let their status exempt them from punishment. Zero tolerance for hate speech, harassment, and bullying . This includes racism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and similar offenses. Permanent bans should be issued for these. 3. Command Usage Using Commands for Personal Gain or Assisting Players Unfairly Commands should not be used for personal advantage or cheating. Do not teleport yourself or others for non-moderation reasons. Do not use /oi (open inventory) to transfer items between players, steal, or read personal content like written books. Do not exploit your admin status to manipulate players. Exceptions End Fight or similar events : Teleporting latecomers to the stronghold is permitted to ensure a timely start. Bug-related losses : Players may be refunded from creative mode or given XP only if they died due to a bug. (If using a grave system, ensure the grave did not spawn first to prevent item duplication.) Returning stolen items : Items may be transferred via /oi only for restoring stolen property. 4. Specific Command Guidelines CoreProtect Always screenshot logs before issuing punishments for evidence. Players should never have access to inspection commands to prevent vigilante actions. Only rollback for griefing , not accidental explosions (e.g., creepers) unless another player caused damage maliciously. Prevent duplication by ensuring that rolling back does not restore removed items after they were manually retrieved from chests. OpenInv Do not manipulate players' inventories or remove items without reason. Avoid checking shulker boxes unless necessary. If you lack a preview mod, place them only while the player is offline and return them as found. Screenshot inventories when investigating theft, x-ray usage, or duping. Never plant evidence.

By adhering to these standards, we ensure the information remains consistent, accessible, and clear for everyone who uses it. Whether you\u2019re adding new content, updating existing documents, or contributing to the knowledge base in any way, these standards should be followed to maintain quality and usability. 1. Writing Style Clarity & Simplicity Write in clear, concise language . Avoid jargon or overly complex sentences. Ensure that each section is easy to understand for both new and experienced players. Ensure correct punctuation is used. Tone & Voice Maintain a neutral and professional tone throughout the documentation. While we encourage an engaging voice, avoid being overly casual. Focus on maintaining an informative and helpful tone. Avoid humor or informal language unless appropriate for specific contexts. Consistency Use consistent terminology across all documents. For example, if referring to players with certain roles (e.g., \"Admins,\" \"Moderators\"), make sure the same terms are used everywhere. For technical terms, provide definitions or explanations if they are not common knowledge (e.g., \"plugins,\" \"datapacks\"). Abbreviations and acronyms should be spelled out the first time they appear, followed by the abbreviation in parentheses (e.g., \"Staff Member (SM)\"). Use active voice whenever possible (e.g., \"Players must follow these rules,\" not \"These rules must be followed by players\"). 2. Document Structure Headings & Subheadings Use clear, hierarchical headings and subheadings to break up large blocks of text and improve readability. Example structure: # Main Heading (for major sections) ## Subheading (for secondary sections) Avoid using other levels of heading. Major sections should be numbered and separated with a horizontal rule --- . Numbered & Bulleted Lists Use bulleted lists for unordered information and numbered lists for step-by-step instructions or when order matters. Lists should be simple and to the point, with each bullet or number point containing a single idea. Formatting Use bold for important terms, commands, or concepts that need emphasis (e.g., /ban ). Use italics for examples or to highlight less important details (e.g., note ). Code snippets (commands, config examples) should be wrapped in backticks to enclosed them in code blocks. Avoid using excessive caps or underlining. Links Use internal links for cross-references to other parts of the knowledge base (e.g., see the Contributing Guidelines ). External links should be relevant to Grimwald, such as linking to resources or tools directly used on the server. Use clear link text that describes the destination (e.g., \u201cClick here for the economy setup guide\u201d instead of \u201cclick here\u201d). 3. Content Guidelines Accuracy & Up-to-Date Information Only accurate, verified information should be included in the knowledge base. Always check that any changes to the server, rules, or guidelines are reflected in the documentation. If you're unsure of a specific detail, check with the relevant staff member or consult other sources before publishing or submitting for review. Completeness Each document should cover the subject comprehensively . Ensure that all aspects of the topic are explained, including potential FAQs or common issues. If necessary, include step-by-step instructions , examples , and troubleshooting tips for clarity. Objectivity Maintain an objective point of view when discussing issues such as player reports, rule enforcement, or conflict resolution. Avoid personal opinions or biased language. Avoid sentitive topics, real world drama or anything that could be damaging to the brand. see the Brand Guidelines . Do not mention players or members of staff by their real or online names anywhere in these documents. Community Input All major changes or new sections should be reviewed by staff before being finalized. Encourage players to provide feedback on documents that are unclear or incomplete. 4. Updating the Knowledge Base Review Process Staff members should periodically review documentation for accuracy and clarity. Changelog entries should be included whenever a significant change is made to a document. Version Control Maintain version control for all documents. 5. Accessibility Language & Localization Consider the global nature of Grimwald and avoid region-specific language or terms. All docs should be written in American English (E.g. localization instead of localisation, color instead of colour.) 6. AI Using AI To Adhere To Standards This document can be fed to AI alongside your new or changed document to ensure you are adhering to the standards.

Tracking the Stats Grimwald uses two Vanilla Tweaks datapacks to track player statistics: Track Statistics Track Raw Statistics These datapacks must be installed at the start of each season and can be found at Vanilla Tweaks . If the datapacks are not available for the current server version: Use the latest available version if no technical changes have occurred. Update to the correct version once available; new statistics will only begin tracking after the update. If running an older Minecraft version, download the appropriate datapack version from Vanilla Tweaks. Although other methods exist to access player stats, the Grimwald formatter is designed specifically for these datapacks. Using alternatives would require extensive manual work or reprogramming. 2. Extracting and Formatting Stats Extracting Stats Download the scoreboard.dat file from the server's data folder. Download and install Python . Download and install NBTExplorer . Download the Grimwald Stat Formatter . Open Command Prompt as an administrator in the NBTExplorer directory. Run the following command, replacing PATH with the correct location: nbtutil --path \"PATH\\scoreboard.dat\\data\\PlayerScores\" --printtree --json \"main.json\" Move the generated main.json file within your NBTExplorer directory into the MainStats directory within the Stat Formatter. Using the Formatter Open main.py in the formatter project. Edit the aliases section if needed: Example format: [\"NewName\", [\"OldName1\", \"OldName2\"]] Only add players who have changed their name. Run main.py . When prompted, choose to run the full program and output for website . Find the output files inside the output folder. Manual Formatting Steps Remove any rows where the score is 0 . Remove any entries belonging to banned players. Convert playtime from minutes into hours by dividing by 60 . Convert distances tracked in centimeters (cm) into meters (m) by dividing by 100 . Distances labeled as (Blocks) should be treated as meters as blocks are cubic meters. Combine diamond statistics : Merge the regular diamond and deepslate diamond stats into a single total. Modify the deepslate diamond file to reflect the combined total. After combining, reorder players if necessary so the highest scores remain at the top. Round all converted values to two decimal places . 3. Adding Stats to the Website Updating the Files Navigate to the public/stats directory. Open stats.html : Update the season number in both the <title> tag and the <h1> header. Open stats.js : In the const scoreboardData section, replace each block with the newly formatted data. Note: The name of the diamond stat in this file is slightly altered to reflect the diamond stats being combined Updating the Navbar Open app/components/Navbar.js . Update the season number displayed in the Stats button text. 4. Important Notes Test all changes locally before pushing them live.
